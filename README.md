# ArtDockGuestbook
## Open source project for decentralized Guestbooks in art exhibitions
ArtDockGuestbook is an open-source, guestbook platform for setting up a system of throwing money to art exhibitions and building relationships between artists and viewers.

Organisers can register their exhibitions, integrate a system of viewer donations, and build relationships with viewers while distributing badges to participants. Viewers can collect participation badges while viewing the exhibition and throwing money to the artist.

We provide a new infrastructure for art to make the art community more open.
